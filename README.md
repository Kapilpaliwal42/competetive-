# competetive-
- this repo is for all the competetive programming codes I do

- mostly.you will find my codes in c++/c only

- find all challanges [here](https://assessment.hackerearth.com/challenges/college/iiit-allahabad-test-draft-2-15/problems/)

## capitalbaazi

- this challange was not that tough for me

- [you caan find the challenge here]((https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/algorithm/capitalbaazi/))(if it still exist!)

### WHAT LEARNED?
1. **there can be multiple spaces**

2. (*learn it by yoursef*)


## Jiya's Sequence
- I found this one a bit tough
- [you caan find the challenge here](https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/algorithm/jiyas-sequence/)(if it still exist!)

### WHAT LEARNED?
- finding the modulo of each input also gives the same LSD(*least significant digit*)
- if the inputs / **test cases** are really big the code will obviously fail (solution was above statement)
