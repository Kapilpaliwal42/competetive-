# competetive-
- this repo is for all the competetive programming codes I do

- mostly.you will find my codes in c++/c only

- find all challanges [here](https://assessment.hackerearth.com/challenges/college/iiit-allahabad-test-draft-2-15/problems/)

## day 1


### capitalbaazi

- this challange was not that tough for me

- [you caan find the challenge here]((https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/algorithm/capitalbaazi/))(if it still exist!)

#### WHAT LEARNED?
1. **there can be multiple spaces**(make sure you handle that)

2. (*learn it by yoursef*)


### Jiya's Sequence
- I found this one a bit tough
- [you caan find the challenge here](https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/algorithm/jiyas-sequence/)(if it still exist!)

#### WHAT LEARNED?
- finding the modulo of each input also gives the same LSD(*least significant digit*)
- if the inputs / **test cases** are really big the code will obviously fail (solution was above statement)

## day 2

### GPL
- THIS WAS TOUGH FOR ME,NOT TOO MUCH BUT YEAH IT WAS
- [you can find the challenge here]((https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/algorithm/gpl/))

#### WHAT LEARNED?
- I should be more careful when i do some logical error


### City Tour
- honestly,in start when i made the concept and successfully executing the program,I thought that it is a shortcut to get right answer.
- then I used AI,and it generated the same.so yeah i done it
-[you can find the challenge here]((https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/algorithm/city-tour/))

#### WHAT LEARNED?
- it could be more hard,but though it was good!

### Too lazy to name the question
- firstly i didn't understood the concept,and then the concept was not the problem
- bigger input was problem
- [you can find the challenge here]((https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/algorithm/city-tour/))

#### WHAT LEARNED?
-use bigger containers like [long long](long-long)
-and maybe dynamic containers like vectors

## day 3

### Christmas tree of height N
- yeah it was really hard for real 
- i didn't see the tree carefully and searched **binomial coefficient** and applied the formula(*big mistake*)
- I wasted hours for finding a container that stores 40!
- [you can find the challenge here](https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/algorithm/christmas-tree-of-height-n/)

#### WHAT LEARNED?
- observe better

### Monk and his love for Primes
- this was much easy than last one
- i have done it in hurry and at once because it was **last...**
- [you can find the challenge here](https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/algorithm/monk-and-his-love-for-primes/)

#### WHAT LEARNED?
- **LERN FROM THE MISTAKES AND THEN DON'T REPEAT!**
